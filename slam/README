This package contains MATLAB code and example textures to accompany the paper,

 "Self-Similar Texture for Coherent Line Stylization,"

Archive contents:
    ./code      : MATLAB scripts. Depends on the matlabPyrTools and 
                  textureSynth libraries (see below).

    ./textures  : a few example textures from the paper.

Quickstart:

    1. Download Javier Portilla and Eero Simoncelli's matlabPyrTools 
       and textureSynth code from:

       http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/texture/

       and place them next to the 'code' directory. You will probably
       also want to compile the associated MEX files.

    2. Load an exemplar texture. For example, 
       
       dots = imread('../textures/dotted-512x8.png');

    3. Create the artmap by specifying the exemplar, the width of the 
       bottom of the pyramid, and the distance between levels (use
       powers of two):

       artmap = makeHalfPyramidArtmap(dots, 1024, 32);

    4. View the results and their associated noise seeds:

       showLineArtmap(artmap);

    5. Save the images, along with a '3dt' text file of the filenames:

       saveLineArtmap(artmap, 'myartmap');


Notes:

    The artmaps are meant to be loaded into an OpenGL 3D texture. Hence, 
    by default saveLineArtmaps stretches each image to the maximum dimensions 
    of the artmap before saving. This behavior can be changed in
    saveLineArtmaps.m.
